# Rock Python Scissors 

Rock, Python, Scissors is a .py file that the user can run in Anaconda Prompt to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. 

The python script uses a while loop that will continue to prompt the user to play RSP until they decline. While in play mode, the user will input (r)ock, (p)aper, (s)cissors and a randomly generated response is printed and a winner is declared.
